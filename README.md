#About
1. We need to use Xbee to send RPC to ensure the direction and distance from the parking lot. After ensuring the direction and distancem, the car would go to the parking lot backward.
2. We need to use OpenMV to follow the line, and modify the direction of the car if it goes away from the line.
3. We need to use OpenMV to find the position of Apriltag and go forward to it.
